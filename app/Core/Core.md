### Global README for Core Application Framework

**Overview:**
This README provides a comprehensive overview of the core components of the application framework located in `C:\xampp\htdocs\Teammate\teammate\app\Core`. It outlines the purpose, functionalities, relationships, and use cases of each PHP file and associated documentation (.md files) within the core library.

### Core Components

- **Application.php**
  - **Purpose:** Serves as the heart of the application, initializing core components and managing the application lifecycle.
  - **Key Methods:** Constructor, `run()`, `loadConfig()`.
  - **Use Cases:** Entry point for web requests, orchestrates configuration loading, request handling, and response sending.
  - **Relationships:** Interacts with `Config`, `Router`, `Request`, `Response`, `Database`, `Logger`, and `SessionManager`.
  - **Optimization:** Leverage dependency injection for better testing and flexibility.

- **Config.php**
  - **Purpose:** Manages application configuration settings.
  - **Key Methods:** `load()`, `get()`.
  - **Use Cases:** Centralized configuration management for database connections, app settings, etc.
  - **Relationships:** Used by `Application`, `Database`, potentially others for configuration data.
  - **Optimization:** Implement caching for configuration data to reduce I/O operations.

- **Database.php**
  - **Purpose:** Provides a singleton database connection.
  - **Key Methods:** `getInstance()`.
  - **Use Cases:** Database operations across the application.
  - **Relationships:** Utilized by models and some core components needing database access.
  - **Optimization:** Consider using connection pooling for scaling in high-traffic scenarios.

- **ErrorHandling.php**
  - **Purpose:** Centralizes error and exception handling.
  - **Use Cases:** Global error logging and presentation of user-friendly error messages.
  - **Relationships:** Interacts indirectly with all components; directly logs through `Logger`.
  - **Optimization:** Enhance with more granular error types and handlers for specific exceptions.

- **Logger.php**
  - **Purpose:** Facilitates logging across the application.
  - **Key Methods:** `log()`, `debug()`, `info()`, `error()`.
  - **Use Cases:** Error logs, audit trails, debug messages.
  - **Relationships:** Can be utilized by any component to log application events or errors.
  - **Optimization:** Integrate with external logging/monitoring services for real-time analysis.

- **Request.php**
  - **Purpose:** Wraps HTTP request data.
  - **Key Methods:** `get()`, `post()`, `hasPost()`, `method()`, `uri()`.
  - **Use Cases:** Accessed by `Router` and controllers to handle client requests.
  - **Relationships:** Essential for request routing and processing in controllers.
  - **Optimization:** Extend to support other HTTP methods and request types (JSON, XML).

- **Response.php**
  - **Purpose:** Manages HTTP responses.
  - **Key Methods:** `setStatusCode()`, `addHeader()`, `sendContent()`.
  - **Use Cases:** Sending responses to client, setting headers, and status codes.
  - **Relationships:** Used by `Router`, controllers, and error handling to send HTTP responses.
  - **Optimization:** Add support for more content types and caching headers.

- **Router.php**
  - **Purpose:** Routes HTTP requests to specific handlers.
  - **Key Methods:** `get()`, `post()`, `dispatch()`.
  - **Use Cases:** URL mapping to controller actions.
  - **Relationships:** Directly interfaces with `Request` for URI and method, and controllers for dispatching.
  - **Optimization:** Implement middleware support for authentication, caching, etc.

- **SessionManager.php**
  - **Purpose:** Initiates sessions and manages session data.
  - **Use Cases:** User authentication status checks and user data retrieval.
  - **Relationships:** Utilizes `User` model for fetching user data based on session info.
  - **Optimization:** Integrate secure session handling practices, CSRF protection.

### General Improvements and Recommendations

- **Unnecessary Code:** Regularly review each component for dead code and refactor for clarity and maintainability.
- **Scaling Possibilities:** Look into asynchronous processing for heavy operations, especially in `Database.php` and `Logger.php`.
- **Smarter Approaches:** 
  - Use modern PHP features like typed properties and arrow functions for cleaner code.
  - Implement an Interface or Abstract Class for common functionalities across components.
- **Usage Guidelines:** Each .md file provides detailed documentation on using the respective PHP files, make sure to consult them for best practices.
- **Removal Guidelines:** Removing a core component requires careful consideration of dependencies. Ensure all related code and references are also removed to avoid breaking the application.
